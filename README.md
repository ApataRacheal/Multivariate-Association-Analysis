## Bacterial infection and drug resistance data association analysis

This is a repository fro custom code genomic analysis of antibacterial drug resistance
variables:
	Gene presence
	Gene absence
	Antibiotics resistance phenotypes
		susceptible
		resistant
		intermediate
		undetermined
  The gene presence an dabsence data were correlated with the resistant phenotypes to identify genes that are predictive.
